# AgroTrust AZ

## One-line pitch

AgroTrust AZ is a B2B export-ready marketplace that helps Azerbaijani cooperatives sell directly to foreign buyers through digital traceability, credible certification signals, and escrow-style trust payments.

## The problem

Azerbaijan exports strong non-oil agricultural products, especially tomatoes, hazelnuts, and persimmons. Yet small and mid-sized farmers often struggle to access high-value buyers because:

- Export buyers expect traceability and recognised standards.
- Certification and compliance are difficult to prove in a simple, buyer-friendly way.
- Farmers rely on middlemen who capture a large share of the margin.
- Cross-border transactions carry trust and payment risk.

The result is a market where quality may exist, but confidence and direct access do not.

## The opportunity

Global buyers increasingly prioritise:

- Verified origin.
- Transparent handling history.
- Standardised quality documentation.
- Reliable payment mechanisms.

A lightweight, export-focused trust platform can unlock new revenue for rural producers while supporting the national non-oil growth priority.

## The solution

AgroTrust AZ connects farmer cooperatives to foreign wholesale buyers with a digital quality ledger and simple verification experience.

Core building blocks:

1 - Digital Product Passport
A QR-verifiable record of:

- harvest date
- origin region and farm metadata
- fertiliser and input notes
- photos
- traceability timeline
- linked certifications

2 - Certification signal layer

A structured way to attach key standards such as:

- GlobalG.A.P
- Organic
- HACCP
- ISO 22000
- Halal where relevant for Gulf markets

The MVP simulates issuer workflows while clearly showing how real registry integrations can be added later.

3 - Escrow-style trust payment
A buyer deposits funds which are released after a successful inspection checkpoint.
This reduces risk for both sides and lowers dependency on intermediaries.

4 - B2B marketplace and RFQ flow
Buyers can post demand and receive competitive cooperative offers that link back to lots and passports.

## Why now

- Export markets increasingly require proof, not promises.
- Digital compliance is becoming a baseline expectation.
- Azerbaijan’s agricultural growth strategy benefits from new trust infrastructure that raises the value of rural production.

## Target users

Supply side:

- mid-sized farms
- farmer cooperatives
- export-oriented producers

Demand side:

- supermarket procurement teams
- wholesale importers
- regional distributors in:
  - Russia
  - UAE
  - EU corridors

## MVP scope

The hackathon MVP demonstrates:

- lots and cooperative discovery
- passport creation and QR verification
- certification status signals
- RFQs and cooperative responses
- escrow init and release with a clear timeline

The focus is a coherent trust narrative rather than full legal or blockchain implementation.

## Value proposition

For cooperatives:

- higher margins through direct access
- better buyer confidence
- clearer pathway to premium markets

For buyers:

- faster due diligence
- lower fraud and quality risk
- transparent, comparable offers

For the ecosystem:

- stronger non-oil export branding
- rural economic empowerment
- improved compliance culture

## Competitive edge

AgroTrust AZ combines three capabilities often separated across tools:

- marketplace demand and supply matching
- passport-level traceability
- payment trust mechanics

This integrated approach reduces friction and makes export readiness simple to demonstrate.

## Business model (future)

Potential revenue streams:

- subscription tiers for cooperatives
- per-passport or per-lot verification services
- certification support packages
- escrow transaction fees
- enterprise buyer dashboards

## Roadmap

Phase 1

- strengthen passport UX
- expand mock datasets
- add basic contract flow

Phase 2

- integrate real certification registries
- enable document evidence uploads
- add border inspection admin role

Phase 3

- multi-language expansion for export corridors
- structured compliance scoring
- deeper logistics and cold-chain events

## Demo storyline

A short, judge-friendly sequence:

1) A cooperative lists a tomato lot.
2) The cooperative creates a Digital Product Passport.
3) The passport displays a traceability timeline and a QR.
4) A certification signal appears on the lot and passport.
5) A buyer verifies the passport.
6) The buyer reviews an RFQ and a cooperative offer.
7) The buyer initiates escrow.
8) The system releases payment after simulated inspection.

This shows a complete trust journey from farm to border-ready trade.

## Closing

AgroTrust AZ turns export readiness into a simple, verifiable, and fair B2B experience. By combining traceability, certification signals, and escrow-style trust, we help Azerbaijan’s agricultural producers reach better markets and keep more of the value they create.
